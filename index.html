	<h1>Prog Rock Database Project</h1>
	
	<p>
		Welcome to my (George Chadderdon's) Prog Rock Database Project.  This was my first 
        effort (in 2010) to develop a database web application.  It 
		is a searchable database of progressive rock music with links to 
		information about the bands and their albums.  The phenomenon 
		of prog rock rock began in the mid-60s in the United Kingdom, probably 
		inspired largely by the experimentations of the Beatles.  One of the 
		earliest prog rock albums was The Moody Blues' <i>Days of Future Passed</i>, 
		a concept album with orchestral interludes between the folk/world 
		music-flavored rock pieces.  The prog rock movement largely died in the mid-70s, 
		but had a brief resurgence in the 80s.  Most, though not all, of these groups 
		are or were British.  Typical prog rock groups: King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, 
		ELP (Emerson, Lake, and Palmer), Van Der Graaf Generator.
